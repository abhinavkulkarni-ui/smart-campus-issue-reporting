## 🧩 Problem Statement
In college campuses, students face daily infrastructure issues such as broken lights, water leakage, cleanliness problems, damaged classrooms, and network issues.  
Currently, these issues are reported verbally or through informal methods, which leads to delays, lack of tracking, and no accountability.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The Smart Campus Issue Reporting System is a web-based platform where students can easily report campus-related issues using their mobile or laptop.  
Each reported issue is tracked digitally, and campus authorities can view, manage, and resolve issues through an admin dashboard.

The system improves transparency, faster resolution, and accountability in campus infrastructure management.
